                    <p>Here is a story of how Data and Information were proven to be vital for different systems, <br>and how different information
                        systems and support systems help us perceive different kinds of data.</p>

                    <p>The Number Systems is a crucial part of a computer program, as they only read 0's and 1's at most. Learning these 
                        types of Number Systems will not only make us program computers better, but also make us understand the world around us.</p>

                    <p>You may say Hardware and Software are similar, but they are mostly different. But they do work together in the same machine together.
                        This portfolio will show you how they work together in different community institutions.</p>

                    <p>If you think all motherboards are the same, think again. There a number of motherboards who function diffently dpeending on what they are made for.
                        This topic will dive into the different kinds of motherboards and how they are used in different situations.</p>

                    <p>Not all computers work the same, but they do have the same function, to compute data. Different computers compute different amounts of data,
                        so in this topic, we will compare and contrast different kinds of computers, along with their specifications and builds.</p>
